    <string name="about_fragment">"\n" I graduated from Centennial College Software
        Engineering Advanced Diploma program in April 2019 and I have significant
        experience in programming in Java and C# developing API, mobile and web
        applications with databases. I have a master’s degree in economics and
        big experience of working as an economist so I can utilise my strong
        analytical skills while writing code.
        "\n" At my study period at Centennial College, I gained extensive abilities in software
        designing and testing working alone as well as in a team.
        I performed numerous projects in JAVA and C# and acquired significant skills in coding.
        My knowledge on data structure concepts and algorithms helps me to
        achieve the maximal performance
        and effectiveness of my code.
